    Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint made of pigment suspended in acrylic polymer emulsion. Acrylic paints are water-soluble, but become water-resistant when dry. Otto RÃ¶hm is the one who invented acrylic resin, but it was quickly transformed into acrylic paint. In the early 1934, the first usable acrylic resin was developed by German chemical company BASF.
