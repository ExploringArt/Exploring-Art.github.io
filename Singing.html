  	Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice and augments regular speech. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, and religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, ghazal and popular music styles such as pop, rock, and electronic dance music.
